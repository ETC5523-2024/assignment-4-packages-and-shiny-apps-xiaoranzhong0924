# Exploring U.S. Federal Holidays

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to provide tools for analyzing U.S. Federal Holidays. This package allows you to explore the historical evolution of established holidays and analyze trends in proposed holidays. It includes a Shiny app to help users interactively explore the dataset.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-xiaoranzhong0924) with:

```r
# Install from GitHub using remotes package
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-xiaoranzhong0924")
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example that shows how to load the package and access some of its functions:

```{r example}
# Load the package
library(assign4)

# Explore the dataset
head(federal_holidays)
```

### Shiny App

This package includes a Shiny app that allows users to explore U.S. Federal Holidays interactively. To launch the app, use the following command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
launch_shiny_app()
```

The app provides an interface to filter holidays by year, explore trends, and analyze proposed holidays.

### What is special about using `README.Rmd`?

Using `README.Rmd` allows us to include R code chunks directly in the README, which can dynamically generate output (e.g., plots, tables). For example, the following code generates a plot:

```{r pressure, eval = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
