# assign4: Exploring U.S. Federal Holidays

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **assign4** is to provide tools for analyzing U.S. Federal Holidays. This package allows you to explore the historical evolution of established holidays and analyze trends in proposed holidays. It includes a Shiny app to help users interactively explore the dataset.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **assign4** from [GitHub](https://github.com/ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-xiaoranzhong0924) with:

```r
# Install from GitHub using remotes package
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2024/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-xiaoranzhong0924", subdir = "assign4")
```

## Example

Hereâ€™s a basic example that shows how to load the package and access some of its functions:

```{r example}
# Load the package
library(assign4)

# Explore the dataset
head(federal_holidays)
```

### Shiny App

This package includes a Shiny app that allows users to explore U.S. Federal Holidays interactively. To launch the app, use the following command:

# Launch the Shiny app
launch_shiny_app()

The app provides an interface to filter holidays by year, explore trends, and analyze proposed holidays.

### What is special about using `README.Rmd`?

Using `README.Rmd` allows us to include R code chunks directly in the README, which can dynamically generate output (e.g., plots, tables). For example, the following code generates a plot:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly to keep `README.md` up-to-date. The function `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
